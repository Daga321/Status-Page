    Welcome to the official status page for all of Daga321's projects! ðŸš€  
    Here you can check the **real-time** status and uptime of my websites and apps.  
    Powered by [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org) and GitHub Actions â€“ no servers, just pure automation!  
    If you see any issues, I'm probably already working on it. ðŸ˜‰  
    Stay tuned for updates!
